This video tells the story of a fleet of Starfury ships approaching a strange, large object in space. The leader of the Starfury ships must investigate what this object is. Upon doing this, a large group of Minbari Cruiser ships morphs out of this strange object, chasing the leader of the Starfury ships. The leader must safely evade the enemies.

Introduction: The scene begins with the slow movement of a fleet of Starfury ships moving towards a large object. The camera slowly pans across the fleet of ships. Then the camera moves towards the large object, revealing what it looks like. A second camera zooms in to the object to show what it is. A planet-like object is seen rotating in a circle.

Build-Up: A fleet of ominous ships moves towards the camera. These ships (Minbari Cruisers) have spawned out of the large, mysterious object.
